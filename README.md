# Python convery belt sorting 
Final project written in Python3.10 that incorporates timing to place and sort packages on a constantly moving conveyor belt. Packages then move down the conveyor belt and automatically programmed arms fire to "grab" the package when it comes within the range of one of ten arms.

| Progress            | Requirement                                                                                 |
| :------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :white_check_mark:  | You will generate a random number between 1 â€“ 10 that corresponds to the sorting lanes      |
| :white_check_mark:  | These numbers will directly correlate to the zip codes between 00000 and 99999              |
| :white_check_mark:  | The GUI interface should have a Start/Stop button, reset button, counter display, indicators when the sorting arms fire (activate), and a list of the current queue of packages on the conveyor.                                                              |
| :white_check_mark:  | Each box will be assigned a unique ID, the sort lane, and the number the counter has to match to the system counter to trigger the sorting arm.                                                                                                                |
| :white_check_mark:  | The box will be removed from the list after it is sort                                      |
| :white_check_mark:  | The entire process should be documented via writing to a log file                           |
| :warning:           | The stop button should stop the conveyor, but leave all the information intact. That is, it works like a pause button.                            |
