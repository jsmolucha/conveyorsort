| :rocket:            | You will generate a random number between 1 â€“ 10 that corresponds to the sorting lanes      |
| :white_check_mark:  | These numbers will directly correlate to the zip codes between 00000 and 99999.             |
| :white_check_mark:  | The system will have 10 lanes and the lanes are 10ft apart and the conveyor moves a 1ft/sec |
| :warning:           | Alias for user should be different every time to preserve anonymity                         |
| :white_check_mark:  | Chat should differentiate every message and they should be easy to read                     |
