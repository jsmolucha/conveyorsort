# Python sorting 
Final project written in Python3.10 that incorporates timing to place and sort packages on a constantly moving conveyor belt. Packages then move down the conveyor belt and automatically programmed arms fire to "grab" the package when it comes within the range of one of ten arms.

| :white_check_mark:  | You will generate a random number between 1 â€“ 10 that corresponds to the sorting lanes      |
| :white_check_mark:  | These numbers will directly correlate to the zip codes between 00000 and 99999              |
| :white_check_mark:  | The GUI interface should have a Start/Stop button, reset button, counter display, indicators when the sorting arms fire (activate), and a list of the current queue of packages on the conveyor.                                                              |
| :warning:           | Alias for user should be different every time to preserve anonymity                         |
| :white_check_mark:  | Chat should differentiate every message and they should be easy to read                     |
